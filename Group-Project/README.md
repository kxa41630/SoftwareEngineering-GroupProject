How did we work?

1. Planning: 
At first we made a planning of what are the tasks/activities in the project we choose and 
the simple project we choose was "guess the number game".
There are three tasks in our project.
-> developing the working logic for the project.
->Validations for the project.
->Intergration of the work in github

Each one of us have choose each task and have worked on them.

About the Project : Guess the number Game in python

-> Our project is a simple guess the word game where 
    1. At first the user is asked whether he wants to play the game or not.
    2. If the player enters any text other than the number, the input is validated and the user gets the message "Oh no!, that is not a valid value. Try again..."
    3. If Yes, the user will be asked to guess the number between 1 and 10..
    4. If no, the code gets terminated.
    5. If the user guesses wrong and is higher than expected he gets a clue saying the number is lower and vice versa.
    6. If the user guesses it right He wins the game and gets a message saying "Nice! You got it!"  
    7. The player is asked if he wants to play the game again.
